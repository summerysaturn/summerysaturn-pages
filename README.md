[![summerysaturn.github.io Header](.github/preview.png)](https://summerysaturn.github.io/)

This is my personal website, hosted through Github pages, utilising react and react-bootstrap. Effectively a portfolio/CV as well as a hub for my contact information and social media accounts.

## Deployment & Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

This command builds, just the same as `npm run build`, except also publishing it to github pages. The URL is written in `package.json`, and should be replaced if you're cloning/forking.
